## Objective

The objectives of the conference organisation are: to learn the conference theme, to describe the entire process of conference organisation, to learn how to manage a conference and to learn how to make effective communication with the conference speakers, chairs, attendees and other conference organisers.In a nuttshell, to keep the alignment of the objective of this graduate course, the aims of the conference was to give students like me, the opportunity to learn how to organise a conference and practical experience of so doing.

However, these objectives could be fulfill if students get an opportunity to work as conference organisers. Moreover, if the students get an opportunity during their research programme to organise a conference, as an individual or as part of an organising committee that is a great way to learn. The reasons are obvious, since, the conference may address a general or specific theme and may attract participants from local institute or even can get international exposure.

I got involved with the conference as an organizer as well as an author so that as a student I can be centrally involved in organising the conference along with my academic unit.


## Conference theme and motivations
The second Insight Student Conference 2015, which was a great opportunity to share research works with other students across the Insight sites and with other researchers overall took place at the Bailey Allen Hall, National University of Ireland, Galway on Friday 30 October, 2015 and was open to all students from the Insight centeres in Ireland. 

The ultimate target was to make the use of it to get feedback on student's research work and ambitions and make this event a success by contributing our research works to find collaborators and to socialize across the Insight sites and the Irish academic sites overall. The motivation of organising this conference was listed below: 

- To discuss our research work with our colleagues,

- To train our presentation skills and our poster preparation skills, 

- To test our latest ideas against fellow researchers and let these ideas to take into a mature submission state, which might involve conference or workshop or even journal submissions,

- To learn about the ongoing research work at the other Insight sites across the Ireland,

- To help the students of early stage in presenting their research interests and potential early hypotheses,

- To validating and testifying ones results of mature stage to let others provide feedback and challenge someone's results.

## Participants
About 160 Insight members (including CEO, Directors, Unit Leaders, Postdoctoral researcher, PhD Students, MS Students, Intern, Collaborators and stuffs) came from the different Insight centres across the Ireland to connect with other researchers and learn about the interesting and varied work going on across the organisation from:

- Insight Centre for Data Analytics, National University of Ireland, Galway(NUIG),

- Insight Centre for Data Analytics, Dublin City University(DCU),

##Organizing steps
The typical steps involved in the organising the conference include drafting and disseminating calls for papers, assessing and selecting best papers, inviting speakers, identifying and inviting conference chairs, organising the conference venue, organising travel and subsistence for speakers, making up conference packs, arranging paper streams, administrating finances, manging the event on the day and handling publication of any conference proceedings and finally writing a report. 

As a student, I got to have several experience from call for paper to finishing the conference program.

###Step-1: Organising meeting
Before sending the call for abstract submissions, we had several meetings with the Director of Insight@NUIG Prof. Dr. Dietrich Rebholz-Schumann who guided us for the whole event including how to organise, how to communicate and how to manage the whole thing smoothly. 

Before that he contacted the unit leaders and Director from the other Insight centres across the Ireland to ensure the conference date and schedule. 

###Step-2: Call for abstracts
All students were invited to submit a 1-page extended abstract summarising their current research (by Friday 25 September 2015) via EasyChair website: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=insightsc2015.  

###Step-3: After submissions
All the submitted abstracts were reviewed by Insight researchers who provided feedback on the abstract. Some best abstracts received the opportunity for a short presentation at the conference and also played an important role for the review of all Insight centres in November towards international exposures:

- Conference webpage: https://www.insight-centre.org/content/insight-student-conference-2015, which includes the submission guidelines and templates(poster and paper), program schedule, information about conference venue (physical location and Google maps) and program details.

- Conference EasyChair webpage: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=insightsc2015.

### Submission statistics
Total 124 abstracts were submitted from the 4 Insight centeres across the Ireland. Among those, 119 papers got acceptance with minor corrections and 3 got acceptance with major corrections and 2 abstract got rejected because of not having signaficant research coontributions. In addition, 150 participants registrated for the event and made the event successfull.

##Lesson learned 
I participated to the event as an organizer & author, where, I learned:

- How to increase effective communication, 

- How to work as a team to organise a successfull even like conference 

- How to manage conference website, 

- How to create conference managment through the EasyChair 

- How to do manage the submissions, 

- How to do the review process and sending the acceptance/rejection notifications

- How to manage a big event like conference within a short time frame. 

On the day of the event, I have had several experience for example, for the first time I demonstrated my poster to the event, had talk to the researchers from the different countries. Also learned how to interact with the session chairs and the program committee. 

The last but on the least, now I know how to organise an event like organising a conference or workshop that will help me for doing the same in the future a lot. 

Now I would like add the comments of the Insight@NUIG Director, Prof. Dr. Dietrich Rebholz-Schumann: 

"I wish to extend my deepest appreciation and admiration towards the wonderful hard work undertaken by so many students at Insight NUI Galway over the last few weeks that culminated in yesterday's excellent conference and on Thursday night at the Threesis final. 

A big 'Thank You' (Míle Buíochas in Irish) to the student conference organisers, the conference speakers, the compilers of the conference posters, the Insight presenters who competed in the previous Threesis heats and to Mihael Arcan who represented our centre so well in Thursday's final of NUIG's Thesis-in-3 challenge. You all make me so proud to work here in Insight. 

I think it was a cool conference on Friday, it went smoothly, and there was nothing - in terms of wishes/needs - left open. Excellent result, for a rather short time frame and a tough goal, i.e. to get a large number of PhD students (in the range of 80%) to submit their work".
